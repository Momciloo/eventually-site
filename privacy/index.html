  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Eventually (the “<strong>extension</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Eventually browser extension and related services. We display this policy before you sign up or use the service, as required by policies such as the <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X Developer Policy</a>. Our practices are intended to be no less protective of your privacy than <a href="https://x.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X’s Privacy Policy</a> where they apply to your use of X through our extension.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account and identity information</strong> – When you sign in with X (Twitter), we receive information from X’s OAuth flow that may include your X user ID, display name, handle, profile image URL, and email (if provided by X). We do not store your X password.</li>
    <li><strong>Bookmarks and X content</strong> – When you use the sync feature on x.com/i/bookmarks, the extension reads the bookmarks visible on that page (e.g. post IDs, URLs, text, author handle and name, media URLs, timestamps) and may send this data to our backend (e.g. Supabase) to store and sync your bookmarks. This data is treated as personal data when it can be linked to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical and usage data</strong> – We may store your session (e.g. auth tokens) locally in the browser’s extension storage so you stay signed in. We do not collect your browsing history outside of the X bookmarks page when you choose to sync.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the extension’s features (sign-in, bookmark sync, and backup).</li>
    <li>Authenticate you and keep your session.</li>
    <li>Operate, secure, and improve our service and fix issues.</li>
    <li>Comply with applicable law and enforce our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share This Information</h2>
  <p>We may share information as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With X (Twitter)</strong> – Sign-in and use of X’s services are subject to X’s Privacy Policy. When you sign in with X, X receives information per their OAuth and data practices. We do not share your synced bookmarks back to X except as needed to use X’s sign-in or as required by law.</li>
    <li><strong>With our service providers</strong> – We use Supabase (and possibly other providers) to run our backend and store data. These providers process data on our instructions and are bound by confidentiality and data protection commitments.</li>
    <li><strong>For legal reasons</strong> – We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government request, or to protect our or others’ rights, safety, or property.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use X content or information obtained through the extension to target you with advertising outside of X’s platform, in line with the X Developer Agreement and Policy.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <p>We retain your account and bookmark data for as long as your account exists or as needed to provide the service and comply with law. You can stop using the extension and sign out at any time. We use industry-standard measures (including secure connections and access controls) to protect your data; no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access or receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correct or update that data.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights or ask questions about your information, contact us using the details below. We will respond in line with applicable law. For data X holds, you may need to contact X directly (see <a href="https://x.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X’s Privacy Policy</a>).</p>

  <h2>6. Children</h2>
  <p>Eventually is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate. We take steps so that such transfers are consistent with applicable law (e.g. standard contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms where required).</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the current version in the extension or on our website and indicate the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice where required by law.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For any inquiries or requests regarding your information, this Privacy Policy, or our practices (including to request access, correction, or deletion of your data), please contact us:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By email: at the contact address published for Eventually (e.g. on the extension’s store listing or website).</li>
    <li>By mail or other contact method if we publish it on geteventually.com or in the extension.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will respond to legitimate requests within the timeframes required by applicable law.</p>
